# Real-Time-Data-Pipeline-For-Monitoring-Autonomous-Vehicles
## **Overview**
This project showcases the infrastructure of a real-time data pipeline designed for autonomous vehicles. It simulates vehicle telemetry and sensor data using Python, streams the data into Apache Kafka topics, processes it with Apache Flink to generate real-time alerts, stores the processed data in TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL), and visualizes insights using Streamlit. The entire pipeline is containerized using Docker for seamless deployment and scalability.
